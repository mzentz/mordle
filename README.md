# mordle
Mordle is my own implementation of the popular game Wordle. This is a training app for me to hone my knowledge or completely learn the following technologies:
- .Net API (expert)
- .Net Identity Services (OAuth via Google, Facebook, Microsoft) (new)
- TypeScript & Angular (semi-knowledgeable)
- Redis In-Memory DB (new)
- Azure SQL (expert)
- Microservice Architecture (knowledgeable)
- Test Driven Development (TDD) (new)
- Docker & Kubernetes (new)

This is a big undertaking. But since I play the game daily and am highly interested in all of these technologies, I think I'll get into this.
